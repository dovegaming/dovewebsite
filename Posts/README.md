# i got an idea!

make a new file for every post, title will be title of post, then vars set to diffrent things ex

> author = 'Pl608'

> date = '11/15/21'

> content = 'lorem ipsum'

something like that

and it could simply be a .py or somthing and then import something that sends it


and guess what it would be pretty hard to do this but it would be nice once it is done
